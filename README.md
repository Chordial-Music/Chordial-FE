## Chordial is a visually stunning web application that helps aspiring and professional musicians discover compelling harmonic ideas. When a user chooses a chord, Chordial suggests compatible harmonic destinations. Users may save their created harmonic sequences as well as edit previous creations.

## Chordial leverages [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. 

## Chordial's user auth is created from scratch using Nodejs/Express, [bycrpt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs), [JWT](https://jwt.io/), and React Context. 

## Chordial is deployed using [Netlify](netlify.com) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Chordial's backend repo lives [here](https://github.com/Chordial-Music/Chordial-BE).

## Chordial's audio playback uses Javascript's built-in Audio() constructor. The tones for each chord are root based triads, recorded by the authors using Logic's Rhodes Stage Piano software instrument.

## The chord theory behind Choridal was created by the authors who have decades of composition experience between them. Not all possibile chord relations were included to avoid complications, keeping realistic boundaries within the framework. You can see the chord relations [here](https://github.com/Chordial-Music/Chordial-FE/blob/main/src/data/data.js).
